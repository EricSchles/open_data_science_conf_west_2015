I'm going to figure out the cities that each census block is in and then create a geo-bounding box for the cities with over 25K people in New York State.

I'm going to do this by:

1) reading in the census zip code data
2) Matching the zip code data to the city it belongs to
3) matching the census block from the zip code to the city
4) creating a dataset with the city label on each census block
